Ditto provides a flexible and efficient way to store and manage data so you can efficiently sync data for a wide range of use cases.&#x20;

Different data structures in Ditto have distinct behaviors and characteristics that you'll need to be familiar with to achieve your specific goals. &#x20;

This article provides a quick overview of Ditto's [Data Structures and Types](docId\:FXfiuIK0OjdZ4JNlja-75) and [Data Structures and Types](docId\:FXfiuIK0OjdZ4JNlja-75).&#x20;

# Schema-Flexible Document Objects

Ditto stores data in structured JSON-like document objects. Each document consists of sets of human‑readable fields that identify and represent the information the document stores.&#x20;

Each document is nested with a hash-stable tree structure that self-describes the data to be stored and provides the predetermined rules that ensure data consistency and accuracy.&#x20;

In simpler terms, each document in Ditto is essentially a key-value pair, where the key is a name (`string`) and the value can be any supported type in Ditto, which includes `maps`. For more information, see [Data Structures and Types](docId\:FXfiuIK0OjdZ4JNlja-75), as follows.

## Supported Types

In Ditto’s document model, the supported data types depend on the CRDTs associated with the document. For more information about CRDTs, see the *Platform Manual *> [Data Types](docId\:o6tgaPfjmAgPseuUV9c_q) and [Document Model](docId\:utI2PcPnojh74wHSuRD9R).

The following snippet provides an example of a basic JSON‑like document object:

```json
{
  "_id" "123abc",
  "name": "Sam",
  "age": 45,
  "isOnline": false
}
```

## Document Size and Sync Performance

Syncing large documents can significantly impact network performance. Instead of storing files exceeding 250kb directly within a document object, carefully consider using `attachments` .&#x20;

:::hint{type="warning"}
Caution is advised when handling large binary data, such as a high‑resolution image or video exceeding 50 megapixels; a deeply embedded document; or a very large document.

## Fields

A document consists of sets of fields that self‑describe the data it encodes. Each set signifies a single pair of two associated elements:

*   The name identifying the data. (See [Fields and Key-Values](docId\:LK2WRxdaf3jbwkbmSt7Mb))

*   The value that holds the actual data to store. (See [Fields and Key-Values](docId\:LK2WRxdaf3jbwkbmSt7Mb))

Required and randomly generated and assigned by default upon creation, the first set of fields identifies the document. (See [Data Structures and Types](docId\:FXfiuIK0OjdZ4JNlja-75))

## Document Identifiers

The first set of fields within each document uniquely identifies the data that its document object encodes. When grouped in a collection, this `_id` serves as the primary key* *identifying the document in the collection.&#x20;

Ditto automatically generates and assigns each new document a unique identifier, or `_id`.

However, if desired, you can pass your own custom `_id` as a parameter in the `upsert` function you use to create a new document. (See [CRUD Fundamentals](docId\:x9YPjApp1GwU0VSQOO_Jh))

In addition to having the option to supply your own `_id`, in complex scenarios where you want to create a more intricate and unique identifier for your documents, you can combine two or more distinct elements to form a composite key.&#x20;

For more comprehensive information and how-to instructions, see the *Platform Manual *> [CRUD Operations](docId\:g7Aefxlq_jeAlr7yh_23B) > [Upserting and Updating](docId\:jIvL6tlL3qvW6r1L4xyS3).

## Collection Indexes

If there is a set of documents that contain the same commonly-queried field, such as a string reference to `cars`, you can optimize query speed and reduce peer storage usage by grouping them in an index, or a *collection*.&#x20;

The following snippet and corresponding table provide an example of a string reference to the collection `cars`.

```javascript
const carsCollection = ditto.store.collection('cars')
```

To help better understand, think of a collection* *like a SQL database *table* and the documents it holds* *like table *rows*:

## Attachment Objects

To improve performance, instead of storing a file that encodes large amounts of binary data as a document, you can opt to store it as a separate, explicitly fetched object known as an `attachment`.

With the `attachment` CRDT, you can sync between peers without querying and merging.&#x20;

For a realworld usage scenario, see either the demo chat app for iOS or Android in the getditto > [demoapp-chat](https://github.com/getditto/demoapp-chat/tree/main) GitHub repository. For instance, in the [iOS demo chat app](https://github.com/getditto/demoapp-chat/tree/main/iOS), you can see a savvy implementation of `ATTACHMENT` with a full-resolution avatar image from a collection named `User`.

For more comprehensive information and how-to instructions, see the *Platform Manual *> Data Types > [Data Types](docId\:o6tgaPfjmAgPseuUV9c_q).

## Relationship Models

There are two methods to linking related data items and organizing them for easy lookup: through an embedded JSON object that functions as a `REGISTER` type or through an embedded `MAP`.

Both approaches use a foreign-key relationship to establish a structure resembling a parent-child hierarchy, where the key functions as the parent, and its encapsulated values, represented as a set of key-value pairs, serve as children.

The choice between a `MAP` and an embedded JSON object that functions as a `REGISTER` depends on your app's usage patterns and the specific conflict resolution requirements in your data model.&#x20;

The following table provides a complete overview of the relationships you can establish in Ditto:&#x20;

| **Relationship** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                           | **Approaches**                                                                                                          |

| Many-to-many     | Associates multiple entities in one collection with multiple entities in another collection.&#x20;                                                                        | *   Embed a `map`&#x20;

*   List items in an `array`

*   Create references between documents in different collections |
| Many-to-one      | Associates two or more collections, where one collection refers to the primary key of another collection to create a meaningful relationship between the datasets. &#x20; | *   Embed a `map`

*   Create references between documents in different collections                                     |

# Advanced Data Types

As a semi-structured distributed database, Ditto leverages conflict‑free replicated data types (*CRDT*) technology to enable advanced data exchange capabilities. 

To get the most out of Ditto, you'll need to work with one or more CRDTs. The`register` type is the most common and simple type to use. 

For more information, see *Platform Manual *>* * [Data Types](docId\:o6tgaPfjmAgPseuUV9c_q).

## Overview

The following table provides a quick overview of the advanced data types you can use in Ditto, along with their guiding principles for conflict resolution, or *merge semantics*, a brief description, and a common usage scenario:

:::hint{type="info"}
In Ditto’s document model, the supported primitive data types depend on the CRDTs associated with the document. For an overview of the data types that each CRDT allows, see *Platform Manual *> [Data Types](docId\:o6tgaPfjmAgPseuUV9c_q).
