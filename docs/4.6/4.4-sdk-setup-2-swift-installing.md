You can integrate the Ditto SDK into Swift projects to develop native apps for Apple iOS and macOS platforms.&#x20;

:::hint{type="info"}
For a complete overview of the platforms, transports, and devices the Kotlin SDK supports, see [Compatibility with Swift](docId\:KkDzWn_atKc5xO79Wkn8i).
:::

:::hint{type="info"}
Ditto does not offer native support for apps developed in Objective-C.&#x20;

If you want to use the Ditto SDK for Swift with an Objective-C app, you must use a bridge to integrate.

For a code walkthrough on how to create a bridge that calls into Swift from Objective-C, see the getditto > [example-swift-bridge-to-objectivec](https://github.com/getditto/example-swift-bridge-to-objectivec) repository in GitHub.

To install the Ditto SDK and start syncing offline:

(1)

Confirm that you meet the minimum requirements. ([Installing Swift SDK](docId\:AhOaG3KgvwHOx12xKZDs0))

(2)

Install the necessary dependencies. ([Installation: Swift](docId\:AhOaG3KgvwHOx12xKZDs0))

(3)

Set up your app permissions. ([Installation: Swift](docId\:AhOaG3KgvwHOx12xKZDs0))

(4)

Authenticate with the Big Peer and then start syncing offline. ([Installation: Swift](docId\:AhOaG3KgvwHOx12xKZDs0))

# Prerequisites

Following are the minimum requirements that must be met before attempting to install Ditto.

*   iOS version 13.0

*   macOS version 11.0

# Adding Package Dependencies

:::::tabs

:::tab{title="CocoaPods"}
Before installing Ditto using CocoaPods dependency manager, do the following:

(1)

Make sure you have CocoaPods version 1.1.0 or later installed. For installation and upgrade instructions, see the official CocoaPods [*Getting Started*](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation) Guide.

(2)

In your project's Podfile, add the line `use_frameworks!`to indicate that you want to use dynamic frameworks for the pods you're integrating.

(3)

Add the DittoSwift framework with version 4.3.0 by running the following in your project directory:

```none
pod 'DittoSwift', '=4.3.0'
```

(4)

Run the following to install the latest version of the dependencies:

```none
pod install --repo-update
```

# Configuring Permissions

Once you've added dependencies:

(1)

From Xcode, add a new **Custom iOS Target Properties** entry:

1.  From the left navigator area, click your project.

2.  In the editor that appears, click **Info** tab.

3.  Right-click any row in the list, and then select **Add Row** from the menu.

:::hint{type="info"}
For instructions on configuring permissions for your app, see the [Installing Swift SDK](docId\:AhOaG3KgvwHOx12xKZDs0) > [Installation: Swift](docId\:AhOaG3KgvwHOx12xKZDs0) topic.

(2)

From your project's `Info.plist`file, add the following key-value pairs, and then, if applicable, modify each string assigned to `Value`:

*   Once implemented, the following string values display as a prompt to your end users explaining why the app requires certain permissions.&#x20;


*   If your end users prefer a language other than English, replace the string values with their language equivalents.

::::tabs
:::tab{title="From Info Tab"}
```none
Key: NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription
Type: String
Value: Uses Bluetooth to connect and sync with nearby devices

Key: NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription
Type: String
Value: Uses WiFi to connect and sync with nearby devices

Key: NSBonjourServices
Type: String
Value: _http-alt._tcp.
```
:::

:::tab{title="From Source Code"}
```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Uses Bluetooth to connect and sync with nearby devices</string>
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Uses WiFi to connect and sync with nearby devices</string>
<key>NSBonjourServices</key>
<array>
  <string>_http-alt._tcp.</string>
</array>
```
:::
::::

(3)

From Xcode, ensure your app continues to sync while it runs in the background, as well as when the end-user device is locked by enabling **Bluetooth Background Modes**:

1.  From the left navigator area, click your project.


2.  Click **Signing & Capabilities**.
    &#x20;

3.  From **TARGETS**, select your app from the list.&#x20;


4.  From **Background Modes**, click to select **Uses Bluetooth LE** **accessories** from the list.

# Integrating and Initializing Sync

Once you've set up your environment, import the Ditto SDK in your codebase and obtain your access credentials.

:::hint{type="warning"}
Unless you have a specialized use case, such as a government app, you must connect to the internet at least once before you can sync offline with other peers.&#x20;

For more information, see *Ditto Basics *> [Authentication and Initialization](docId\:Pc5gf25-wFo_AtgbSu1IL).
:::

(1)

From the top-most scope of your app's codebase, add the following to set up authentication and start syncing offline.

(2)

Replace `YOUR_APP_ID` and `YOUR_PLAYGROUND_TOKEN` with your access credentials available from the portal.&#x20;

:::hint{type="info"}
For instructions on how to obtain your access credentials, see [Onboarding](docId\:UUFFlh8kUJSsgS5Pc6mTO). For an introduction to authentication in Ditto, see *Ditto Basics* > [Authentication and Initialization](docId\:Pc5gf25-wFo_AtgbSu1IL).
:::

```swift
let ditto = Ditto(identity: .onlinePlayground(
    appID: "YOUR_APP_ID",
    token: "YOUR_PLAYGROUND_TOKEN"
))

do {
  try ditto.startSync()
} catch (let err) {
  print(err.localizedDescription)
}
```
