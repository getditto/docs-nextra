To get started right away without having to build an app from scratch, explore with the Ditto ready-to-use demo task app.

# Prerequisites

Before you can install Ditto, you must have the following:&#x20;

*   Ditto access credentials

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) long-term support (LTS) version 14.x (or later)

*   Linux, macOS version 11 (or later), or Windows version 10 (or later)

*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

*   Integrated developer environment (IDE)

*   To get your access credentials, complete the [Onboarding](docId\:UUFFlh8kUJSsgS5Pc6mTO).

*   You can use any IDE you prefer; however, to ensure optimatibility with the platform, Ditto recommends using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

# Installing the Demo Task App

To install Ditto in your environment, install and set up Ditto, and authenticate your client identity with the Big Peer:

(1)

Clone the [getditto > template-app-nodejs-todo](https://github.com/getditto/template-app-nodejs-todo/) repository from GitHub:

```none
git clone https://github.com/getditto/template-app-nodejs-todo/
```

(2)

Install the required dependencies:

```none
npm install
```

(3)

Open the project in your IDE, and then open the `index.ts` file. For example, if using Visual Studio Code:&#x20;

```none
code .
```

(4)

In line 14 of the `index.ts` file, replace `'YOUR_APP_ID'` and `'YOUR_TOKEN'` with your app ID and playground token. (*Ditto Basics *> [Signing Up](docId\:UUFFlh8kUJSsgS5Pc6mTO))

```typescript
// replace YOUR_APP_ID and YOUR_TOKEN with p
ditto = new Ditto({ type: 'onlinePlayground', appID: 'YOUR_APP_ID', token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' })
```

(5)

Build the demo task app:

```none
npm run build
```

(6)

Interact with the demo task app and simulate real-time peer-to-peer replication by running the demo task app in two or more separate terminals (one for each virtual peer):

```none
node index.js
```

(7)

Using the commands that automatically appear in each of your terminals, add, remove, and modify documents as desired.

(8)

If you want to observe your changes sync with the cloud-optional deployment, the [Discover the Fundamentals](docId\:mccAKB7fi6ypalbyM99-T), open the data browser in the [Ditto portal](https://portal.ditto.live/).
