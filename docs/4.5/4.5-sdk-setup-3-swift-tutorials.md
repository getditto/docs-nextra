¹If using `OnlineWithAuthentication`, you are required to integrate a third-party identity provider with your app.&#x20;

:::hint{type="info"}
Auth0 is Ditto’s preferred third-party identity service provider; however, you can use any you prefer. If you are using a third-party service provider other than Auth0, refer to your provider’s official documentation in addition to this tutorial as needed.&#x20;
