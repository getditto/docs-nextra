Ditto stores data in structured JSON-like document objects. Each document consists of sets of human‑readable fields that identify and represent the information the document stores.&#x20;

# Documents and Collections

Each document is nested with a hash-stable tree structure that self-describes the data to be stored and provides the predetermined rules that ensure data consistency and accuracy.&#x20;

The following snippet provides an example of a basic JSON-encoded document object:

```json
{
  "_id": "abc123",
  "make": "Hyundai",
  "year": 2018,
  "color": "black"
}
```

## Fields

A single document consists of one or more *fields *that self‑describe the data it encodes. Each field is associated with a *value*:

*   1.  *Field* — The name identifying the data. (See [Fields and Key-Values](docId\:dg-NwzCc3CmXTQTUUWTwi))


    2.  *Value* — The value that holds the actual data to store. (See [Fields and Key-Values](docId\:dg-NwzCc3CmXTQTUUWTwi))

## Document Identifiers

The first set of fields within each document uniquely identifies the data that its document object encodes. When grouped in a collection, this `_id` serves as the primary key* *identifying the document in the collection.&#x20;

### Assigning \_id

Ditto automatically generates and assigns each new document a unique identifier, or `_id`. However, if desired, you can pass your own custom `_id` as a parameter when performing an `INSERT` operation to create a new document. (See [CREATE](docId\:BdqJxnd0CqGABk15wXue0))

In addition to having the option to supply your own `_id`, in complex scenarios where you want to create a more intricate and unique identifier for your documents, you can combine two or more distinct elements to form a composite key.&#x20;

For example, the following snippet demonstrates how to create (`INSERT`) a new document with a composite key formed by the `vin`, `make`, and `year` fields — all of which remain immutable. So, once set at initial document creation, their values cannot be changed.&#x20;

:::codeblocktabs
```swift
let result = await ditto.store.execute(
  query: "INSERT INTO cars DOCUMENTS (:newCar)",
  arguments: [
    newCar: [ "_id": "123", "color": "blue"]
  ]);

// "123"
print(result.mutatedDocumentIDs()[0])
```

```kotlin
var result = ditto.store.execute(
  "INSERT INTO cars DOCUMENTS (:newCar)",
  mapOf("newCar" to mapOf("_id" to "123", "color" to "blue")))
  
// "507f191e810c19729de860ea"
println(result.mutatedDocumentIDs().first())
```

```javascript
const newCar = {
  _id: "123",
  color: "blue"
}

const result = await ditto.store.execute(`
  INSERT INTO cars
  DOCUMENTS (:newCar)`,
  { newCar });

// "123"
console.log(result.mutatedDocumentIDs()[0])
```

```java
Map<String, String> newCar = new HashMap<>();
newCar.put("_id", "123");
newCar.put("color", "blue");

DittoQueryResult result = (DittoQueryResult) ditto.store.execute(
    "INSERT INTO cars DOCUMENTS (:newCar)",
    Collections.singletonMap("newCar", newCar),
    new Continuation<>() {
        @NonNull
        @Override
        public CoroutineContext getContext() {
            return EmptyCoroutineContext.INSTANCE;
        }

        @Override
        public void resumeWith(@NonNull Object o) {
            if (o instanceof Result.Failure) {
                // Handle failure
            }
        }
    }
);

// "123"
System.out.println(result.mutatedDocumentIDs()[0]);
```

```csharp
var insertArgs = new Dictionary<string, object>();
insertArgs.Add("newCar", new { _id = "123", color = "blue" });

var result = await ditto.Store.ExecuteAsync(
  "INSERT INTO your_collection_name DOCUMENTS (:newCar)",
  insertArgs);
  
// "123"
result.MutatedDocumentIds.ForEach(id => Console.WriteLine(id));
```

```cpp
std::map<std::string, std::map<std::string, std::string>> args;
args["newCar"] = {{"_id", "123"},{"color", "blue"}};

auto result = ditto.get_store().execute(
  "INSERT INTO cars DOCUMENTS (:newCar)",
  args).get();

// "123"
std::cout << result.mutated_document_ids()[0].to_string();
```

```rust

# Data Formatting

As a semi-structured database, data formatting in Ditto is categorized into two main groups:

*   *Data Types* — Advanced types that guarantee conflict-free resolution during merging, which includes the `REGISTER`, `MAP`, and `ATTACHMENT` data type.

    The default data type is `REGISTER` ; you'll use other data types in specific scenarios where appropriate.&#x20;


*   *Scalar subtypes* — Basic primitive types, such as `string` and `boolean`, and the JSON  object, which functions as a single value capable of encapsulating multiple key-value pairs.&#x20;

## Lazy Loading

To improve performance, instead of storing a file that encodes large amounts of binary data within a document, consider storing a reference to it in a separate, explicitly fetched object (token) known as an `ATTACHMENT`.&#x20;

With the `ATTACHMENT` data type, you can implement *lazy loading*. Lazy loading is when you delay retrieval until necessary rather than aggressively fetching the data in anticipation of hypothetical future use. This "on-demand" retrieval pattern enhances performance by optimizing resource usage.&#x20;

For a realworld usage scenario, see either the demo chat app for iOS or Android in the getditto > [demoapp-chat](https://github.com/getditto/demoapp-chat/tree/main) GitHub repository. For instance, in the [iOS demo chat app](https://github.com/getditto/demoapp-chat/tree/main/iOS), you can see a savvy implementation of `ATTACHMENT` with a full-resolution avatar image from a collection named `User`.

## Relationship Models

The following table provides a complete overview of the relationships you can establish in Ditto:&#x20;

| **Relationship** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                           | **Approaches**                                                                                                                                     |

| One-to-many      | Associates a parent element with children elements to establish a hierarchy.&#x20;                                                                                        | *   Embed a JSON object (`REGISTER`)

*   Embed a `MAP`

*   Reference a field to a document&#x20;

*   Reference a document to a collection&#x20; |
| Many-to-many     | Associates multiple entities in one collection with multiple entities in another collection.&#x20;                                                                        | *    Embed a JSON object (`REGISTER`)

*   Embed a `MAP`

*   Create references between documents in different collections                         |
| Many-to-one      | Associates two or more collections, where one collection refers to the primary key of another collection to create a meaningful relationship between the datasets. &#x20; | *   Embed a JSON object (`REGISTER`)

*   Embed a `MAP`

*   Create references between documents in different collections                          |

### Linking Through Foreign-Key Relationships

There are two methods to linking related data items and organizing them for easy lookup: through an embedded JSON object that functions as a `REGISTER` type or through an embedded `MAP`.

Both approaches use a foreign-key relationship to establish a structure resembling a parent-child hierarchy, where the key functions as the parent, and its encapsulated values, represented as a set of key-value pairs, serve as children.

The choice between a `MAP` and an embedded JSON object that functions as a `REGISTER` depends on your app's usage patterns and the specific conflict resolution requirements in your data model.&#x20;
